I use google colab to do this project.And I refer google and pdf that codetech it solutions provide.This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It covers the complete machine learning workflow: data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and performance visualization. The model includes two convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by dense layers to interpret extracted features and classify digits (0â€“9). After training for 5 epochs, the model achieves high accuracy on both training and test data. A plot is also generated to visualize the training and validation accuracy over time. This project serves as a foundational example for image classification using deep learning.
